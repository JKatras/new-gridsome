                                application period, usually ending the following spring.</p>

                        <h4>How do I apply?/What is the application process?</h4>
                        <div>
                            <p>It is recommended that all interested apprenticeship applicants attend the annual
                                Apprentice Job Fair, usually held in February, and visit UVA Facilities Management's
                                website for information on each trade.</p>
                            <p>To apply for a position, visit <a href="https://hr.virginia.edu/careers-uva/job-openings">UVA Job Openings</a>
                                during the application period to fill out and submit an application for the
                                apprenticeship program. Be sure to include all requested documents, as well as any
                                previous trades experience or education you may have.</p>
                            <p>Interviews are scheduled in the spring. Following interviews, finalists will have full
                                background checks facilitated by UVA. Letters will be sent out with formal offers or
                                encouraging applicants to reapply the following year. The Apprenticeship team is happy
                                to attend any high school signing days for selected applicants.</p>
                            <p>At the end of July, new apprentices will begin their onboarding process and prepare to
                                begin work. Recruitment for the next class of apprentices will begin in fall.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h4>When will interviews be scheduled for prospective candidates?</h4>
                        <div>
                            <p>Following review of the applications, finalists are selected for interviews from
                                mid-April to mid-May. Offer letters are sent to selected candidates in late spring/early
                                summer. Onboarding for new apprentices will occur at the end of July.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h4>Am I able to apply if I am already a University employee?</h4>
                        <div>
                            <p>Yes. University employees are eligible to apply for the apprenticeship program. Current UVA employees must apply through their <a href="https://www.myworkday.com/uva/d/home.htmld">Workday</a> profile.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h4>What formal education is required to be considered for the apprenticeship program?</h4>
                        <div>
                            <p>Applicants must have a high school diploma or a General Educational Development (GED) certificate by the time they begin employment as an apprentice. Education beyond high school is not required. However, it is taken into consideration due to the competitive aspect of these positions. If an applicant has completed any technical trades classes, those should also be included on the online application.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h4>What previous trades experience is required to be considered for the apprenticeship program?
                        </h4>
                        <div>
                            <p>While no formal trades experience is required, make sure to include information on your application about any kind of experience you have performing or assisting with trades work as we do consider this due to the competitive aspect of these positions.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h4>What trades are offered through the apprenticeship program?</h4>
                        <div>
                            <p>UVA’s program offers apprenticeships in carpentry, electrical, HVAC, masonry, plastering and plumbing. Exact openings vary from year to year and multiple trades are recruited annually.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h4>How many apprenticeship positions do you have open and how many applications do you typically receive?</h4>
                        <div>
                            <p>Each year, approximately seven to thirteen new apprentices are hired into the program depending on business needs. More than 100 applications are received for each trade position posted.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h4>Is there an opportunity for prospective candidates to ask questions in a face-to-face
                            setting?</h4>
                        <div>
                            <p>All interested applicants are encouraged to attend the Apprenticeship Job Fair each spring where prospective candidates can meet supervisors, current, and graduated apprentices. The next job fair will be held in February 2020. Requests for school visits can be emailed to <a href="mailto:fm-apprenticeship@virginia.edu" aria-label="email F.M. apprenticeship program">fm-apprenticeship@virginia.edu</a></p>
                        </div>

                        <h4>How long is the apprenticeship program?</h4>
                        <div>
                            <p>Over the four year program, apprentices learn their selected trade through a combination of on-the-job training, technical education, and classroom instruction.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h4>Is it possible to shorten the length of time for the apprenticeship?</h4>
                        <div>
                            <p>The duration of the apprenticeship program is four years based on the requirements of the <a href="http://www.doli.virginia.gov/apprenticeship">Virginia Department of Labor &amp; Industry</a>. Apprentices must complete more than 400 hours of classroom instruction and 8,000 hours of on-the-job training. The program can be shortened to three years on a case-by-case basis if an apprentice has previously completed some of the required classroom instruction and had previous documented work experience. Since the first year of employment is considered a probationary period for all employees, consideration for crediting an apprentice with previous on-the-job training is not approached until the probationary period is successfully completed.</p>

                        <h4>What is the average salary for an apprentice?</h4>
                        <div>
                            <p>Apprentices begin with an approximate salary of $31,000 plus a full benefits package. The program also covers the cost of education classes and required texts. Each year provided classes are successfully completed, progress is made in learning, and other key requirements are met, apprentices are eligible to receive a salary increase. After graduating from this program, salary is in line with other journey-level staff at UVA F. This year’s graduates will be earning approximately $38,000 - $40,000 depending on any merit increases that may have also been available.</p>

                        <h4>What are the typical hours of an apprentice?</h4>
                        <div>
                            <p>Apprentices are required to work 40 hours per week. While hours may vary, the typical schedule is from 7 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Monday-Friday. Overtime may be required, but supervisors are mindful of apprentice classroom attendance.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h4>What classroom instruction is required?</h4>
                        <div>
                            <p>Over the course of the four year program, apprentices complete 400-plus hours of classroom instruction, providing a well-rounded education as they learn their trade. Current apprentices attend classes at Charlottesville-Albemarle Technical Educational Center, Valley Career &amp; Technical Center, or Massanutten Technical Center. Generally, apprentices are scheduled for one to two classes per semester depending on the school’s program requirements. Apprentices are required to attend classes regularly, complete assignments on time, and achieve passing grades. Progress is monitored closely. Apprentices are subject to the rules and policies of the institution (ie: CATEC, Valley Tech, etc.) offering the classroom instruction.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h4>How many nights per week are there classes?</h4>
                        <div>
                            <p>For each class enrolled, it will typically require one night per week of classroom instruction. This means that apprentices who are enrolled in two classes for the semester will be attending lessons two nights each week.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h4>What on-the-job training is required?</h4>

                            <p>Over the course of the four year program, apprentices are required to complete 8,000 hours of on-the-job training with licensed journeymen, mentors, supervisors, and others who maintain the high quality facilities at the University and the Health System.</p>

                        <h4>How is an apprentice evaluated?</h4>
                        <div>
                            <p>Apprentices are evaluated through assessment of work progress and classroom reports. <a
                                    href="https://apprenticeship.fm.virginia.edu/assets/documents/ApprenticeshipProgramStandards20180710.pdf">Apprenticeship Program Standards</a> apply to and govern all matters related to the program and the

                            apprenticeship?</h4>
                        <div>
                            <p>Apprentices are full-time employees from day one and, if apprenticeship requirements are met (taking and passing classes and learning through on-the-job training), employment is continued with Facilities Management.</p>

                        <div>
                            <p>Those completing the academic work- and job-related training will be awarded certificates from the Virginia Department of Labor & Industry’s Apprenticeship Council. For those trades where a state licensure certification can be obtained, once the apprentice passes that exam they will be promoted to a journey-level job title. For those where no licensure is available, upon receipt of their certificate from the state, they will be promoted to a journey-level job title.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h4>Will the apprentice be required to pay for their own tuition and books?</h4>
                        <div>
                            <p>No. Classes and books that are required as part of the apprenticeship training are paid for by UVA Facilities Management.</p>

                                <li>Apprentices are expected to attend and take part in monthly Apprentice Roundtables. An Apprentice Roundtable is a meeting for all current apprentices to have an opportunity to ask questions and be informed about new developments and opportunities.</li>
                                <li>All apprentices have mandatory shop rotations every three, six, or twelve months. Rotations provide the best education by offering an inside view of their trade in each division within UVA. This creates the most well-rounded tradespeople.</li>
                                <li>Some apprentices are nominated to be on the Apprentice Council, which is an optional position.</li>
                                <li>Some apprentices are nominated to join in annual outreach efforts to schools, career fairs, and job fairs in the area.</li>
                                <li>We ask that apprentices maintain regular communication with UVA Facilities Management's Occupational Programs team about school, their rotations, and general concerns/questions.</li>
